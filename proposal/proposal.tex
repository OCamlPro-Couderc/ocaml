\title{Namespaces for OCaml - Proposal}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

This proposal is about integrating namespaces into the OCaml language, but
without changing the semantics of the language and cluttering it. It aims to be
rather independent from the core language and viewed as a meaning for the user to
describe its compilation environment, and helping the compiler without the need
of external tools for simple compilation.

It tightly binds the build system, the file system and the language together,
helping the compiler to reason about installed libraries.
It focuses on the following points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Semantics in the language
\item Compilation according to namespaces
\item Installation and linking of libraries
\end{itemize}

What we want to solve in particular is integrating the \emph{big-functor} patch
at the namespace level, allowing to have paramteric libraries. At the end, we
present some use case of namespaces.

One particular goal we want to achieve is making a clear distinction between the
language's semantics and the code generation, in other word making the language
more expressive. %% , especially in cases like -pack and -pack-functor, which are
%% defined in the build system but are part of the semantics of the program.

An option had been added then, thanks to ``module aliases'', to avoid linking
necessity when an alias in unused, which simulates a namespace
mechanism. However, it remains an option of the compiler, that triggers a
warning and allows some some vicious links. It will be explained in the next
section.

Our namespaces proposal aims to solve this issue by designing real namespaces,
with a particular semantics, without a hard to understand compilation scheme
introduced by the last version of the compiler.
